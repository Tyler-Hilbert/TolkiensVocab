they looked back: 7
the night was: 7
down on the: 7
of the wood: 7

shoulder of the: 7
which he had: 7
on the land: 7
on the right: 7
shadows of the: 7
under the trees: 7
a line of: 7
he turned and: 7
all the company: 7
but we have: 7
turned to the: 7
you shall have: 7
upon the grass: 7
of the night: 7
that is what: 7
there were no: 7
to try and: 7
on the further: 7
the further side: 7
it was now: 7
they found that: 7
even as they: 7

the way to: 7
were in a: 7
if you have: 7
there are no: 7

into the gloom: 7
of the hall: 7
and for a: 7
on the far: 7

on the door: 7
at the far: 7
i wonder what: 7
soon as it: 7
out in the: 7
a path that: 7
before them and: 7
find a way: 7
to the right: 7
we have come: 7
and then suddenly: 7
to meet them: 7
to the north: 7
he saw that: 7
saw that the: 7
on the left: 7
and the sun: 7
the air and: 7
from the north: 7
a moment he: 7
he was in: 7
of the chamber: 7

at least to: 6
in that time: 6
and it had: 6
not have been: 6
and the other: 6
not of course: 6
at the time: 6
seemed to me: 6
that may be: 6
and a little: 6
be found in: 6
of his journey: 6
in the great: 6
do not wish: 6
the hobbits of: 6
much the same: 6
of bilbo and: 6
of the wise: 6
the same as: 6
in which they: 6
and from the: 6
fell on the: 6
the hobbits had: 6
still in the: 6
they were the: 6
the course of: 6
they crossed the: 6
mountains and the: 6
the mountains of: 6
that had been: 6

the history of: 6
of men and: 6

at that time: 6
to the west: 6
off in the: 6
in the old: 6
north of the: 6

in all the: 6
the grey and: 6
he was a: 6
if the ring: 6

but the ring: 6
was like a: 6
at length they: 6
it was already: 6
soon as he: 6
about the ring: 6
at the gate: 6
the gate and: 6
that did not: 6
have to be: 6
more than half: 6
as you might: 6
a couple of: 6
were going to: 6
look at the: 6
no more of: 6
seen in the: 6
it had a: 6
of it and: 6
but i think: 6
made up my: 6
before long the: 6
food and drink: 6
