midst of the: 21
in the house: 21
to see you: 21
it must be: 21
in the deep: 21
the hosts of: 21
in spite of: 20
a long while: 20
in his own: 20
east of the: 20
and from the: 20
the mountains of: 20
that had been: 20
the most part: 20
away to the: 20
in the light: 20
was like a: 20
him in the: 20
as he could: 20
and at the: 20
but he had: 20
the old forest: 20
a while and: 20
we shall see: 20
in the distance: 20
was in his: 20
i shall not: 20
and to the: 20
i am glad: 20
if you want: 20
there are some: 20
said in a: 20
and all that: 20
he thought he: 20
all the time: 20
i fear that: 20
in his heart: 20
it in the: 20
i wonder what: 20
you are a: 20
to the right: 20
the noise of: 20
this is a: 20
as he spoke: 20
of the men: 20

if he were: 20
at the same: 19
seem to have: 19
in the great: 19
and the hobbits: 19
borders of the: 19
many of the: 19
for the most: 19
so it was: 19
of the rohirrim: 19
of bag end: 19
that he would: 19
they began to: 19
as you might: 19
to the hobbits: 19
all the way: 19
and he said: 19
but at the: 19
he got up: 19
we have been: 19
would be a: 19
as he was: 19
in a low: 19
a low voice: 19
into the night: 19
he stood up: 19
when he had: 19
he gave a: 19
he had never: 19
until at last: 19
of a great: 19
to the great: 19
there in the: 19
do you mean: 19
that there was: 19
and he has: 19
his face was: 19
went to the: 19
will not be: 19
at the foot: 19
which he had: 19
on the right: 19
this way and: 19
go to the: 19
in the valley: 19
we must be: 19
from the west: 19
a glimpse of: 19
when they came: 19
that you were: 19
up on to: 19
and i was: 19
and then suddenly: 19
they had come: 19
came at last: 19
aragorn son of: 19
that we have: 19
do not doubt: 19
as he looked: 19
should like to: 18
of his own: 18
and the other: 18
they do not: 18
do not wish: 18
as they were: 18
slopes of the: 18
in the old: 18
men of gondor: 18
head of the: 18
and went to: 18
to find the: 18
which they had: 18
to tell you: 18
to see the: 18
and they are: 18
to the door: 18
said the wizard: 18
i have heard: 18
into the west: 18
that in the: 18
and his eyes: 18
and i do: 18
but we must: 18
begging your pardon: 18
i can see: 18
the night was: 18
said frodo and: 18
along the road: 18
the black riders: 18
turned to the: 18
on into the: 18
even as they: 18
line of the: 18
come back to: 18
way and that: 18
that i can: 18
back towards the: 18
then suddenly he: 18
they saw that: 18
as he did: 18
of the east: 18
a moment he: 18
the wall and: 18
but if i: 18
at the last: 18
the mouth of: 18
and now he: 18
said aragorn and: 18
that we are: 18
walls of the: 18
the riders of: 18
the ephel dï¿½ath: 18
of dol amroth: 18
houses of healing: 18
them in the: 17
the elder days: 17
for the present: 17
of their own: 17
they were in: 17
the folk of: 17
in their own: 17
the head of: 17
gandalf the grey: 17
at the gate: 17
in minas tirith: 17
of the day: 17
going to be: 17
i think i: 17
it is no: 17
are you going: 17
as i have: 17
and i dont: 17
dont know what: 17
what is it: 17
turned away and: 17
he went on: 17
be able to: 17
i wonder if: 17
to the sea: 17
of him and: 17
i am sure: 17
should have been: 17
into the shadows: 17
last to the: 17
to go and: 17
then with a: 17
but you must: 17
in his mind: 17
the thought of: 17
the walls and: 17
skirts of the: 17
if that is: 17
in a great: 17
he felt that: 17
felt that he: 17
came back to: 17
we are going: 17
at him and: 17
the words of: 17
they found a: 17
and when they: 17
and they could: 17
he did so: 17
to the north: 17
he saw the: 17
saw that the: 17
and with a: 17
coming of the: 17
lay on the: 17
to deal with: 17
the first time: 17
not know what: 17
they heard the: 17
at the top: 17
the doors of: 17
is in the: 17
if you wish: 17
the lord and: 17
minas tirith and: 17
of the emyn: 17
riders of rohan: 17
of the citadel: 17
as it were: 16
of the darkness: 16
when i was: 16
the east and: 16
the eaves of: 16
mountains and the: 16
of men and: 16
of those that: 16
and they had: 16
the battle of: 16
for they were: 16
if they were: 16
from the shire: 16
to the king: 16
bottom of the: 16
the tale of: 16
but it seemed: 16
a couple of: 16
up the hill: 16
they were not: 16
him and the: 16
was not so: 16
if you would: 16
but i dont: 16
a deep breath: 16
was only a: 16
the road to: 16
have come to: 16
frodo he said: 16
but they are: 16
them to the: 16
heart of the: 16
if it was: 16
are going to: 16
his eyes were: 16
his mind and: 16
that is a: 16
and the others: 16
all that i: 16
to think of: 16
the hands of: 16
if you had: 16
you have been: 16
was a long: 16
two or three: 16
went out and: 16
now in the: 16
to the top: 16
in the last: 16
down in the: 16
if they had: 16
it seems to: 16
you will find: 16
servants of the: 16
he said at: 16
that is what: 16
mr frodo said: 16
frodo said sam: 16
they reached the: 16
i will come: 16
to an end: 16
you have come: 16
there seemed to: 16
to them that: 16
to be done: 16
i guess that: 16
i thought i: 16
to be the: 16
before them and: 16
you will not: 16
and as they: 16
of the tree: 16
him that he: 16
either side of: 16
and if they: 16
to meet them: 16
and they saw: 16
wall of the: 16
and then a: 16
and we have: 16
near to the: 16
one of them: 16
from the south: 16
to him and: 16
it will not: 16
of the shadows: 16
as they came: 16
with a cry: 16
of the valley: 16
of mordor and: 16
there will be: 16
the heir of: 16
the white mountains: 16
the lord denethor: 16
men of rohan: 16
at the least: 16
the sons of: 16
the city of: 16
the lady galadriel: 16
of the ents: 16
the captains of: 16
captains of the: 16
one ring to: 15
or at least: 15
there is much: 15
i think that: 15
of the last: 15
is said that: 15
to the shire: 15
to his own: 15
of the misty: 15
in the black: 15
go no further: 15
him as he: 15
as he had: 15
you had better: 15

i wish to: 15
i want to: 15
want to see: 15
but you have: 15
i tell you: 15

i am sorry: 15
where they had: 15
silent for a: 15
one by one: 15
in the hall: 15
a while he: 15
and the wind: 15
that was the: 15
of the fire: 15
what to do: 15
im going to: 15
more than one: 15
would not be: 15
we ought to: 15
i dont suppose: 15
we come to: 15
him as if: 15
i dont want: 15

for i have: 15
and it will: 15
house of elrond: 15
and saw the: 15
the path and: 15
down on the: 15
in the high: 15
i think we: 15
we had better: 15
you did not: 15
the hobbits could: 15
who are you: 15
filled with a: 15
said at last: 15
was no sign: 15
if you understand: 15
there are no: 15
he is not: 15
of the gate: 15
into the gloom: 15
face of the: 15
at the far: 15
but there are: 15
near at hand: 15
of the air: 15
opened his eyes: 15
on the left: 15
the hearts of: 15
could not tell: 15
the air and: 15
light of day: 15
into the dark: 15
for they had: 15
here we are: 15
go with you: 15
between them and: 15
in the shadows: 15
that would be: 15
it would have: 15
but now i: 15
of my own: 15
his sword and: 15
for the first: 15
of all that: 15
and his voice: 15
