it seemed to him that: 25
the paths of the dead: 24
at the end of the: 18
in the midst of the: 17
at the foot of the: 15
the lord of the mark: 15
there was no sign of: 14
the captains of the west: 14
i do not wish to: 13
it seemed to them that: 13
under the shadow of the: 13
the lord of the city: 13
in the middle of the: 12
to the edge of the: 12
the other side of the: 12
i do not doubt that: 12
of the lord of the: 11
i do not know what: 11
in the house of elrond: 10
to the end of the: 10
on either side of the: 10
they had come to the: 10
the lord of the rings: 9
at length they came to: 9
in the light of the: 9
on the edge of the: 9
seemed to him that he: 9
as soon as may be: 9
i do not think that: 9
at the bottom of the: 8
if you want to know: 8
on the other side of: 8
and as he did so: 8
came at last to the: 8
the hilt of his sword: 8
at the head of the: 7
to tell you the truth: 7
as a matter of fact: 7
at last they came to: 7
on this side of the: 7
between the mountains and the: 7
and it seemed to him: 7
there seemed to be a: 7
they came at last to: 7
of the house of eorl: 7
the houses of healing and: 7
in the land of mordor: 6
one ring to rule them: 6
ring to rule them all: 6
you know what i mean: 6
i should like to know: 6
it seemed to frodo that: 6
to the top of a: 6
i dont know said frodo: 6
i do not know the: 6
as if he had been: 6
what do you think of: 6
the eaves of the forest: 6
he opened his eyes and: 6
for a moment and then: 6
he said in a low: 6
said in a low voice: 6
what have you to say: 6
when they came to the: 6
at the top of the: 6
the sword that was broken: 6
they could go no further: 6
what is to be done: 6
in the likeness of a: 6
them all and in the: 5
all and in the darkness: 5
and in the darkness bind: 5
in the darkness bind them: 5
the war of the ring: 5
the misty mountains and the: 5
in the days of the: 5
he drew a deep breath: 5
i am not going to: 5
he laid his hand on: 5
there was a long silence: 5
in the heart of the: 5
that it was not so: 5
they came out of the: 5
to the bottom of the: 5
he caught a glimpse of: 5
the others looked at him: 5
come to the end of: 5
the far side of the: 5
in the midst of it: 5
with their backs to the: 5
and in the midst of: 5
as far as he could: 5
even as he did so: 5
he found that he was: 5
into the shadows of the: 5
we shall have to try: 5
they had not gone far: 5
that he was in a: 5
the north side of the: 5
at the bottom of a: 5
at that moment there was: 5
that moment there was a: 5
at the back of the: 5
of the kings of men: 5
the mountains of shadow and: 5
at the feet of the: 5
they came at length to: 5
it is a long way: 5
we can not get out: 5
at the far end of: 5
the far end of the: 5
the men of minas tirith: 5
out of the north and: 5
but i do not think: 5
of the tower of guard: 5
the rising of the sun: 5
the men of the mark: 5
it was not long before: 5
of the men of gondor: 5
the king of the dead: 5
in the houses of healing: 5
of the houses of healing: 5
praise them with great praise: 5
the land of mordor where: 4
land of mordor where the: 4
of mordor where the shadows: 4
mordor where the shadows lie: 4
one ring to find them: 4
ring to find them one: 4
to find them one ring: 4
find them one ring to: 4
them one ring to bring: 4
one ring to bring them: 4
ring to bring them all: 4
to bring them all and: 4
bring them all and in: 4
by the banks of the: 4
the borders of the shire: 4
the battle of five armies: 4
there was a roar and: 4
at the same time he: 4
and it seemed to me: 4
if you know what i: 4
to the end of his: 4
we will not speak of: 4
the ring in his hand: 4
is not to be wondered: 4
not to be wondered at: 4
into the heart of the: 4
i am not sure that: 4
to the land of mordor: 4
he knows that it is: 4
my heart tells me that: 4
there is only one way: 4
as far as i can: 4
on the borders of the: 4
seemed to frodo that he: 4
to the other side of: 4
the foot of the hill: 4
they came back to the: 4
there was a sound of: 4
out of the trees and: 4
and how do you know: 4
caught a glimpse of the: 4
as fast as they could: 4
from the edge of the: 4
as quickly as they could: 4
to the top of the: 4
the top of the bank: 4
had come to the end: 4
as soon as it is: 4
there was the sound of: 4
his voice sank to a: 4
this side of the river: 4
there is no other way: 4
in and out of the: 4
as well as they could: 4
in the direction of the: 4
the west side of the: 4
looked at him and saw: 4
on the edge of a: 4
they found themselves in a: 4
the man in the moon: 4
if you take my meaning: 4
who are you and what: 4
aragorn son of arathorn and: 4
and for a moment he: 4
he knew that he must: 4
the light of the fire: 4
as far as they could: 4
the men of the west: 4
the mountains and the sea: 4
on the top of the: 4
have nothing to do with: 4
to the ford of bruinen: 4
i do not know but: 4
the edge of the dell: 4
voice sank to a whisper: 4
of elves and men and: 4
when the world was young: 4
he shut his eyes and: 4
as he held it up: 4
i will do what i: 4
will do what i can: 4
to the borders of the: 4
the shadow of the hills: 4
with all the speed they: 4
all the speed they could: 4
the end of the day: 4
the mist before his eyes: 4
to the feet of the: 4
until they came to a: 4
of the servants of sauron: 4
i did not know that: 4
of the dark lord and: 4
the deep places of the: 4
it seemed to me that: 4
came at length to the: 4
the end of the road: 4
of the white mountains and: 4
i do not think you: 4
i do not know answered: 4
seemed to him that the: 4
there is no time to: 4
cried in a loud voice: 4
came to the edge of: 4
had not gone far before: 4
seemed to them that they: 4
and it seemed to them: 4
the third day of their: 4
they were drawing near to: 4
the walls of minas tirith: 4
he stood for a moment: 4
and the shadows of the: 4
lay between them and the: 4
the lady of the wood: 4
do not doubt that you: 4
was lying on his back: 4
along the line of the: 4
in the deeps of time: 4
not yet at any rate: 4
and the men of the: 4
it would have been a: 4
and sat down on a: 4
he sprang to his feet: 4
the riders of the mark: 4
to the lord of the: 4
length they came to the: 4
the fords of isen and: 4
in the shadow of the: 4
i will come with you: 4
they were come to the: 4
did not dare to go: 4
is drawing to an end: 4
last they came to the: 4
and it seemed that he: 4
the towers of the teeth: 4
right mr frodo said sam: 4
the fields of the pelennor: 4
all the hosts of mordor: 4
the coming of the king: 4
the king of the mark: 4
of the paths of the: 4
to the houses of healing: 4
the hands of the king: 4
hands of the king are: 4
the hands of a healer: 4
and they came to the: 4
the warden of the houses: 4
the tower of cirith ungol: 4
the steward of the city: 4
the lady ï¿½owyn of rohan: 4
to rule them all one: 3
rule them all one ring: 3
them all one ring to: 3
all one ring to find: 3
the red book of westmarch: 3
the banks of the great: 3
banks of the great river: 3
between the misty mountains and: 3
after the manner of the: 3
all the lands of the: 3
between the river and the: 3
length they came to a: 3
the history of the war: 3
history of the war of: 3
of the war of the: 3
part of the lord of: 3
it is to be hoped: 3
and in the middle of: 3
for a while and then: 3
come all the way from: 3
all the way from the: 3
there was a dead silence: 3
then he got up and: 3
the end of his days: 3
there was a gleam in: 3
there is no need to: 3
his hand over his eyes: 3
but the time has come: 3
the road goes ever on: 3
road goes ever on and: 3
goes ever on and on: 3
from the door where it: 3
the door where it began: 3
now far ahead the road: 3
far ahead the road has: 3
ahead the road has gone: 3
as far as i know: 3
i will say no more: 3
i have never heard of: 3
he is the chief of: 3
if it were not for: 3
under the dominion of the: 3
it is not to be: 3
am not sure that i: 3
what am i to do: 3
all the same said frodo: 3
to find the cracks of: 3
find the cracks of doom: 3
if you really wish to: 3
and the terror of the: 3
what may you be doing: 3
looked at frodo and smiled: 3
they went in single file: 3
the edge of the wood: 3
and the end of the: 3
but it seemed to him: 3
it was one of the: 3
what are we to do: 3
the shadows of the trees: 3
to the left of the: 3
in the lanes of the: 3
i dont want to be: 3
at that moment there came: 3
that moment there came a: 3
how do you know that: 3
did not answer at once: 3
the shadow of the trees: 3
spoke together in soft voices: 3
up and rubbed his eyes: 3
asked the question that was: 3
he would say no more: 3
a secret known only to: 3
it seems to me that: 3
i do not think the: 3
was silent for a moment: 3
i do not like this: 3
in the affairs of wizards: 3
and fell at once into: 3
i have made up my: 3
have made up my mind: 3
dont know how to say: 3
the north end of the: 3
out from the edge of: 3
but there was no sign: 3
the line of the river: 3
are coming back to live: 3
he said shaking his head: 3
he did not want to: 3
but nothing could be seen: 3
out of the mist and: 3
on the other side the: 3
of the folk of the: 3
they came to a narrow: 3
in the middle of a: 3
tell you the truth i: 3
but if you want to: 3
before the break of day: 3
not like the look of: 3
for a while in thought: 3
made up my mind he: 3
i should not have dared: 3
the floor of the forest: 3
every now and again the: 3
for it seemed to them: 3
and looked out over the: 3
they could find a way: 3
the heart of the forest: 3
than any they had yet: 3
they were in a deep: 3
on the east side of: 3
the east side of the: 3
on the far side of: 3
there could be no doubt: 3
here and there in the: 3
in the midst of a: 3
every now and again they: 3
he felt that he was: 3
and they saw that he: 3
it was no more than: 3
was no more than a: 3
they found that they were: 3
at the same moment the: 3
the light of the sun: 3
know how to deal with: 3
in the west of the: 3
there was much coming and: 3
was much coming and going: 3
in the shadows of the: 3
one thing drives out another: 3
and in spite of the: 3
with a wave of his: 3
a wave of his hand: 3
to keep a hold on: 3
the cow jumped over the: 3
cow jumped over the moon: 3
if you understand me and: 3
there was a heavy silence: 3
if i may say so: 3
ill do what i can: 3
all that is gold does: 3
that is gold does not: 3
is gold does not glitter: 3
gold does not glitter not: 3
does not glitter not all: 3
not glitter not all those: 3
glitter not all those who: 3
not all those who wander: 3
all those who wander are: 3
those who wander are lost: 3
laid his hand on the: 3
they did not dare to: 3
for the first time since: 3
for a moment he stood: 3
it was some time before: 3
they drew near to the: 3
the air was full of: 3
it seemed that he was: 3
was no sign of him: 3
i do not think we: 3
on the north side of: 3
in the last few days: 3
and the light of the: 3
at the end of a: 3
the servants of the enemy: 3
i would dearly like to: 3
and it is said that: 3
got up and walked away: 3
the ring and put it: 3
ring and put it on: 3
the feet of the hills: 3
what is the matter with: 3
it seemed to have been: 3
but they had not gone: 3
he sank to the ground: 3
hilt of his sword and: 3
you seem to know a: 3
on the faces of the: 3
i do not ask for: 3
land between the mountains and: 3
but now i dont suppose: 3
was aware of him and: 3
the deeps of the sea: 3
and the sword of elendil: 3
the feet of the white: 3
for the sword that was: 3
is aragorn son of arathorn: 3
it does not belong to: 3
out of the shadows of: 3
along the skirts of the: 3
and i do not doubt: 3
do not doubt that he: 3
in the deep places of: 3
the arts of the enemy: 3
at least for a while: 3
i think i shall come: 3
on the brink of the: 3
gimli son of glï¿½in for: 3
i thought you were going: 3
thought you were going to: 3
i sit beside the fire: 3
sit beside the fire and: 3
beside the fire and think: 3
the fire and think of: 3
the mountains in the east: 3
in some hollow of the: 3
it seemed to the hobbits: 3
seemed to the hobbits that: 3
about the feet of the: 3
the end of a long: 3
to the brink of the: 3
to the gap of rohan: 3
let us not speak of: 3
that go on two legs: 3
had not been heard in: 3
and out of the shadows: 3
turned their backs on the: 3
until we come to the: 3
was a roar and a: 3
no more than two or: 3
more than two or three: 3
what are you going to: 3
are you going to do: 3
deep places of the world: 3
to the middle of the: 3
i do not like the: 3
there must have been a: 3
as if it were a: 3
he laid it on the: 3
if we get a chance: 3
he cried in a loud: 3
to the level of the: 3
we can not stay here: 3
i would not have you: 3
and held it up and: 3
and the sound of the: 3
for it is said that: 3
it is said that the: 3
the sound of the water: 3
when the wind is in: 3
the wind is in the: 3
the bole of the tree: 3
up on to the high: 3
and it seemed to the: 3
laid his hand upon the: 3
the shores of the sea: 3
the lord and lady of: 3
could hear the sound of: 3
until they came to the: 3
no i am afraid not: 3
dug up bagshot row and: 3
you did not wish to: 3
and then he saw that: 3
its chain about his neck: 3
hills of the emyn muil: 3
as well as he could: 3
you gimli son of glï¿½in: 3
they saw no sign of: 3
in his eye as he: 3
far away in the south: 3
as he did so a: 3
by the men of gondor: 3
the shadow of tol brandir: 3
the enemy is on the: 3
up towards the slopes of: 3
towards the slopes of the: 3
passed his hand over his: 3
he had not gone far: 3
got to get back to: 3
of the emyn muil and: 3
for a moment in thought: 3
wind do you bring to: 3
do you bring to me: 3
knew that he must go: 3
come to the feet of: 3
of the kings of old: 3
his eyes away from the: 3
came up out of the: 3
i must rest a little: 3
said that it was a: 3
the waybread of the elves: 3
came out of the north: 3
he drew his sword and: 3
only the lord of the: 3
for a moment it seemed: 3
in the mines of moria: 3
what would you have me: 3
would you have me do: 3
but i do not doubt: 3
on the very edge of: 3
the old man did not: 3
we are the fighting uruk-hai: 3
the hearts of the hobbits: 3
the last rays of the: 3
out of the reach of: 3
and found that it was: 3
even as he spoke the: 3
the boles of the trees: 3
the stream there was a: 3
to the battle of the: 3
and the riders of rohan: 3
you shall come with me: 3
will come with you said: 3
as they drew near the: 3
the bones of the earth: 3
the very edge of the: 3
under the eaves of the: 3
within the shadow of the: 3
sprang to his feet and: 3
company that set out from: 3
that set out from rivendell: 3
in the nick of time: 3
with the rising of the: 3
you do not know your: 3
he looked at them with: 3
before the doors of the: 3
they had ridden for some: 3
the feet of the misty: 3
feet of the misty mountains: 3
to the fords of isen: 3
ere the coming of the: 3
the wild men of the: 3
in silence for a while: 3
no i dont think so: 3
that there was a great: 3
fell silent for a while: 3
i do not wish for: 3
he did not dare to: 3
had i done so i: 3
seven stars and seven stones: 3
in the woods of the: 3
the woods of the shire: 3
as he did so he: 3
he began to weep and: 3
came to the end of: 3
then he saw that it: 3
he saw that it was: 3
bring us to the gate: 3
for the most part they: 3
the tower of the moon: 3
in the midst of all: 3
of the ephel dï¿½ath and: 3
he saw that frodo was: 3
of the realm of gondor: 3
saw that he was in: 3
the return of the king: 3
the lord of minas tirith: 3
the great gate of the: 3
the people of the city: 3
the court of the fountain: 3
though all the hosts of: 3
to the paths of the: 3
paths of the dead and: 3
to the stone of erech: 3
gate of the city and: 3
the prince of dol amroth: 3
of the men of the: 3
the men of the city: 3
the walls of the pelennor: 3
the shadow of the gate: 3
the gate of the city: 3
the first circle of the: 3
first circle of the city: 3
the house of the stewards: 3
the last remnant of the: 3
the knights of dol amroth: 3
either side of the gate: 3
the lord of the nazgï¿½l: 3
in his eyes and he: 3
and went out and he: 3
of the king are the: 3
the king are the hands: 3
king are the hands of: 3
are the hands of a: 3
to the warden of the: 3
as he looked at the: 3
in the days of its: 3
the love of the lord: 3
captains of the west were: 3
put on the ring and: 3
there was no hope of: 3
almost as if he had: 3
of the captains of the: 3
only for a little while: 3
as they came to the: 3
the walls of the city: 3
