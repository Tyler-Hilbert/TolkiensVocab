on either side of the: 20
in the light of the: 19
on the edge of the: 19
of the lord of the: 18
at length they came to: 18
if you want to know: 18
as soon as may be: 18
i do not think that: 18
i should like to know: 17
seemed to him that he: 17
the lord of the rings: 16
at the bottom of the: 16
at the head of the: 16
to tell you the truth: 16
on the other side of: 16
and as he did so: 16
came at last to the: 16
the hilt of his sword: 16
at the top of the: 16
on this side of the: 15
between the mountains and the: 15
as if he had been: 14
at last they came to: 14
and it seemed to him: 14
at the back of the: 14
they came at last to: 14
it was not long before: 14
of the house of eorl: 14
the houses of healing and: 14
for a moment and then: 13
what have you to say: 13
there seemed to be a: 13
they could go no further: 13
what is to be done: 13
you know what i mean: 12
i am not going to: 12
it seemed to frodo that: 12
to the top of a: 12
i dont know said frodo: 12
i do not know the: 12
what do you think of: 12
the eaves of the forest: 12
he opened his eyes and: 12
in the direction of the: 12
he said in a low: 12
said in a low voice: 12
when they came to the: 12
the sword that was broken: 12
the far end of the: 12
in the likeness of a: 12
one ring to rule them: 11
ring to rule them all: 11
the misty mountains and the: 11
in the heart of the: 11
to the top of the: 11
with their backs to the: 11
as far as he could: 11
he found that he was: 11
on the top of the: 11
at the bottom of a: 11
at the feet of the: 11
they came at length to: 11
the lord of the eagles: 11
in the land of mordor: 10
the war of the ring: 10
in the days of the: 10
the battle of five armies: 10
to the end of his: 10
he drew a deep breath: 10
he laid his hand on: 10
there was a long silence: 10
on the borders of the: 10
that it was not so: 10
they came out of the: 10
to the bottom of the: 10
he caught a glimpse of: 10
as fast as they could: 10
the others looked at him: 10
come to the end of: 10
the far side of the: 10
in the midst of it: 10
and in the midst of: 10
even as he did so: 10
into the shadows of the: 10
who are you and what: 10
we shall have to try: 10
they had not gone far: 10
that he was in a: 10
the north side of the: 10
at that moment there was: 10
that moment there was a: 10
of the kings of men: 10
the mountains of shadow and: 10
it is a long way: 10
we can not get out: 10
at the far end of: 10
the men of minas tirith: 10
out of the north and: 10
but i do not think: 10
of the tower of guard: 10
the rising of the sun: 10
the men of the mark: 10
they were come to the: 10
of the men of gondor: 10
the king of the dead: 10
in the houses of healing: 10
of the houses of healing: 10
praise them with great praise: 10
them all and in the: 9
all and in the darkness: 9
and in the darkness bind: 9
in the darkness bind them: 9
it got in its pocketses: 9
into the heart of the: 9
to the other side of: 9
the foot of the hill: 9
in and out of the: 9
as well as they could: 9
they found themselves in a: 9
they did not dare to: 9
the edge of the dell: 9
he shut his eyes and: 9
to the borders of the: 9
came to the edge of: 9
as well as he could: 9
they were drawing near to: 9
the very edge of the: 9
he did not dare to: 9
over the edge of the: 9
of the men of the: 9
by the banks of the: 8
the borders of the shire: 8
and in the middle of: 8
there was a roar and: 8
at the same time he: 8
and it seemed to me: 8
if you know what i: 8
the end of his days: 8
the ring in his hand: 8
is not to be wondered: 8
not to be wondered at: 8
i am not sure that: 8
to the land of mordor: 8
he knows that it is: 8
my heart tells me that: 8
there is only one way: 8
as far as i can: 8
seemed to frodo that he: 8
they came back to the: 8
there was a sound of: 8
out of the trees and: 8
and how do you know: 8
the shadow of the trees: 8
caught a glimpse of the: 8
from the edge of the: 8
as quickly as they could: 8
the top of the bank: 8
had come to the end: 8
as soon as it is: 8
there was the sound of: 8
his voice sank to a: 8
this side of the river: 8
on the east side of: 8
there is no other way: 8
the west side of the: 8
looked at him and saw: 8
on the edge of a: 8
the man in the moon: 8
if you take my meaning: 8
aragorn son of arathorn and: 8
and for a moment he: 8
he knew that he must: 8
it was some time before: 8
the light of the fire: 8
as far as they could: 8
the men of the west: 8
the mountains and the sea: 8
have nothing to do with: 8
to the ford of bruinen: 8
i do not know but: 8
voice sank to a whisper: 8
of elves and men and: 8
when the world was young: 8
as he held it up: 8
i will do what i: 8
will do what i can: 8
the shadow of the hills: 8
with all the speed they: 8
all the speed they could: 8
the end of the day: 8
the mist before his eyes: 8
to the feet of the: 8
of the servants of sauron: 8
i did not know that: 8
of the dark lord and: 8
the deep places of the: 8
it seemed to me that: 8
came at length to the: 8
the end of the road: 8
of the white mountains and: 8
i do not think you: 8
i do not know answered: 8
seemed to him that the: 8
cried in a loud voice: 8
had not gone far before: 8
seemed to them that they: 8
and it seemed to them: 8
the third day of their: 8
the walls of minas tirith: 8
he stood for a moment: 8
and the shadows of the: 8
lay between them and the: 8
the lady of the wood: 8
do not doubt that you: 8
was lying on his back: 8
along the line of the: 8
in the deeps of time: 8
not yet at any rate: 8
and the men of the: 8
it would have been a: 8
and sat down on a: 8
he sprang to his feet: 8
in the nick of time: 8
the riders of the mark: 8
to the lord of the: 8
length they came to the: 8
the fords of isen and: 8
in the shadow of the: 8
i will come with you: 8
did not dare to go: 8
is drawing to an end: 8
last they came to the: 8
he saw that it was: 8
and it seemed that he: 8
right mr frodo said sam: 8
the return of the king: 8
the fields of the pelennor: 8
all the hosts of mordor: 8
the coming of the king: 8
the king of the mark: 8
of the paths of the: 8
to the houses of healing: 8
the hands of the king: 8
hands of the king are: 8
the hands of a healer: 8
and they came to the: 8
the warden of the houses: 8
the tower of cirith ungol: 8
the steward of the city: 8
one ring to find them: 7
ring to find them one: 7
to find them one ring: 7
find them one ring to: 7
them one ring to bring: 7
one ring to bring them: 7
ring to bring them all: 7
to bring them all and: 7
bring them all and in: 7
the red book of westmarch: 7
between the river and the: 7
what has it got in: 7
has it got in its: 7
it is to be hoped: 7
there is no need to: 7
we will not speak of: 7
what am i to do: 7
they went in single file: 7
what are we to do: 7
to the left of the: 7
the line of the river: 7
on the other side the: 7
in the middle of a: 7
tell you the truth i: 7
before the break of day: 7
not like the look of: 7
every now and again the: 7
the east side of the: 7
in the midst of a: 7
at the same moment the: 7
the light of the sun: 7
if i may say so: 7
they drew near to the: 7
if it had not been: 7
in the last few days: 7
at the end of a: 7
and it is said that: 7
until they came to a: 7
land between the mountains and: 7
king under the mountain and: 7
in the deep places of: 7
to the brink of the: 7
there must have been a: 7
he laid it on the: 7
there is no time to: 7
between the arms of the: 7
and the sound of the: 7
and it seemed to the: 7
they saw no sign of: 7
in the mines of moria: 7
the old man did not: 7
there came the sound of: 7
then he saw that it: 7
the towers of the teeth: 7
the back of the cave: 7
the king under the mountain: 7
the land of mordor where: 6
land of mordor where the: 6
of mordor where the shadows: 6
mordor where the shadows lie: 6
the banks of the great: 6
banks of the great river: 6
between the misty mountains and: 6
after the manner of the: 6
all the lands of the: 6
to be found in the: 6
length they came to a: 6
the history of the war: 6
history of the war of: 6
of the war of the: 6
for a while and then: 6
come all the way from: 6
all the way from the: 6
there was a dead silence: 6
then he got up and: 6
as i have told you: 6
there was a gleam in: 6
his hand over his eyes: 6
but the time has come: 6
the road goes ever on: 6
road goes ever on and: 6
goes ever on and on: 6
from the door where it: 6
the door where it began: 6
now far ahead the road: 6
far ahead the road has: 6
ahead the road has gone: 6
as far as i know: 6
i will say no more: 6
i have never heard of: 6
he is the chief of: 6
if it were not for: 6
under the dominion of the: 6
it is not to be: 6
am not sure that i: 6
all the same said frodo: 6
to find the cracks of: 6
find the cracks of doom: 6
if you really wish to: 6
and the terror of the: 6
what may you be doing: 6
looked at frodo and smiled: 6
the edge of the wood: 6
climbed to the top of: 6
and the end of the: 6
he had a feeling that: 6
but it seemed to him: 6
this part of the world: 6
it was one of the: 6
the shadows of the trees: 6
in the lanes of the: 6
i dont want to be: 6
at that moment there came: 6
that moment there came a: 6
how do you know that: 6
did not answer at once: 6
spoke together in soft voices: 6
now is the time for: 6
up and rubbed his eyes: 6
asked the question that was: 6
he would say no more: 6
a secret known only to: 6
it seems to me that: 6
i do not think the: 6
was silent for a moment: 6
and fell at once into: 6
i am sure it is: 6
i have made up my: 6
have made up my mind: 6
dont know how to say: 6
the north end of the: 6
the banks of the stream: 6
out from the edge of: 6
but there was no sign: 6
are coming back to live: 6
he said shaking his head: 6
he did not want to: 6
but nothing could be seen: 6
out of the mist and: 6
of the folk of the: 6
they came to a narrow: 6
but if you want to: 6
we must away ere break: 6
must away ere break of: 6
away ere break of day: 6
for a while in thought: 6
made up my mind he: 6
i should not have dared: 6
the floor of the forest: 6
for it seemed to them: 6
and looked out over the: 6
they could find a way: 6
the heart of the forest: 6
than any they had yet: 6
they were in a deep: 6
on the far side of: 6
there could be no doubt: 6
as if they had been: 6
here and there in the: 6
the master of the house: 6
every now and again they: 6
he felt that he was: 6
it was no more than: 6
they found that they were: 6
know how to deal with: 6
in the west of the: 6
there was much coming and: 6
was much coming and going: 6
in the shadows of the: 6
one thing drives out another: 6
and in spite of the: 6
with a wave of his: 6
a wave of his hand: 6
to keep a hold on: 6
the cow jumped over the: 6
cow jumped over the moon: 6
if you understand me and: 6
and what do you want: 6
there was a heavy silence: 6
ill do what i can: 6
all that is gold does: 6
that is gold does not: 6
is gold does not glitter: 6
gold does not glitter not: 6
does not glitter not all: 6
not glitter not all those: 6
glitter not all those who: 6
not all those who wander: 6
all those who wander are: 6
those who wander are lost: 6
laid his hand on the: 6
to the north of the: 6
for the first time since: 6
for a moment he stood: 6
a matter of fact he: 6
the air was full of: 6
it seemed that he was: 6
was no sign of him: 6
i do not think we: 6
flung himself on the ground: 6
on the north side of: 6
and the light of the: 6
the servants of the enemy: 6
i would dearly like to: 6
got up and walked away: 6
the ring and put it: 6
ring and put it on: 6
the feet of the hills: 6
what is the matter with: 6
as soon as it was: 6
it seemed to have been: 6
but they had not gone: 6
the sun began to sink: 6
he sank to the ground: 6
hilt of his sword and: 6
you seem to know a: 6
on the faces of the: 6
i do not ask for: 6
but now i dont suppose: 6
was aware of him and: 6
the deeps of the sea: 6
and the sword of elendil: 6
the feet of the white: 6
for the sword that was: 6
is aragorn son of arathorn: 6
it does not belong to: 6
out of the shadows of: 6
along the skirts of the: 6
and i do not doubt: 6
do not doubt that he: 6
the arts of the enemy: 6
at least for a while: 6
i think i shall come: 6
on the brink of the: 6
i thought you were going: 6
thought you were going to: 6
i sit beside the fire: 6
sit beside the fire and: 6
beside the fire and think: 6
the fire and think of: 6
the mountains in the east: 6
it seemed to the hobbits: 6
seemed to the hobbits that: 6
about the feet of the: 6
the end of a long: 6
to the gap of rohan: 6
let us not speak of: 6
that go on two legs: 6
had not been heard in: 6
and out of the shadows: 6
turned their backs on the: 6
until we come to the: 6
was a roar and a: 6
no more than two or: 6
more than two or three: 6
what are you going to: 6
are you going to do: 6
deep places of the world: 6
to the middle of the: 6
i do not like the: 6
as if it were a: 6
if we get a chance: 6
he cried in a loud: 6
to the level of the: 6
we can not stay here: 6
i would not have you: 6
and held it up and: 6
for it is said that: 6
it is said that the: 6
the sound of the water: 6
when the wind is in: 6
the wind is in the: 6
the bole of the tree: 6
up on to the high: 6
laid his hand upon the: 6
the shores of the sea: 6
the lord and lady of: 6
until they came to the: 6
no i am afraid not: 6
dug up bagshot row and: 6
you did not wish to: 6
and then he saw that: 6
its chain about his neck: 6
hills of the emyn muil: 6
in his eye as he: 6
far away in the south: 6
as he did so a: 6
by the men of gondor: 6
the shadow of tol brandir: 6
the enemy is on the: 6
up towards the slopes of: 6
towards the slopes of the: 6
passed his hand over his: 6
he had not gone far: 6
got to get back to: 6
on the last stage of: 6
of the emyn muil and: 6
every now and again he: 6
for a moment in thought: 6
wind do you bring to: 6
do you bring to me: 6
knew that he must go: 6
come to the feet of: 6
of the kings of old: 6
his eyes away from the: 6
came up out of the: 6
i must rest a little: 6
said that it was a: 6
the waybread of the elves: 6
came out of the north: 6
he drew his sword and: 6
only the lord of the: 6
for a moment it seemed: 6
what would you have me: 6
would you have me do: 6
but i do not doubt: 6
on the very edge of: 6
we are the fighting uruk-hai: 6
the hearts of the hobbits: 6
the last rays of the: 6
out of the reach of: 6
and found that it was: 6
even as he spoke the: 6
the stream there was a: 6
in the side of the: 6
to the battle of the: 6
and the riders of rohan: 6
you shall come with me: 6
will come with you said: 6
as they drew near the: 6
and every now and again: 6
the bones of the earth: 6
under the eaves of the: 6
within the shadow of the: 6
sprang to his feet and: 6
with the rising of the: 6
you do not know your: 6
he looked at them with: 6
before the doors of the: 6
they had ridden for some: 6
the feet of the misty: 6
feet of the misty mountains: 6
to the fords of isen: 6
ere the coming of the: 6
the wild men of the: 6
in silence for a while: 6
no i dont think so: 6
the edge of the forest: 6
that there was a great: 6
fell silent for a while: 6
i do not wish for: 6
had i done so i: 6
seven stars and seven stones: 6
at the edge of the: 6
in the woods of the: 6
the woods of the shire: 6
as he did so he: 6
he began to weep and: 6
came to the end of: 6
bring us to the gate: 6
come to a bad end: 6
the tower of the moon: 6
in the midst of all: 6
he saw that frodo was: 6
of the realm of gondor: 6
as fast as he could: 6
saw that he was in: 6
the lord of minas tirith: 6
the great gate of the: 6
the people of the city: 6
the court of the fountain: 6
though all the hosts of: 6
to the paths of the: 6
paths of the dead and: 6
to the stone of erech: 6
gate of the city and: 6
the prince of dol amroth: 6
the men of the city: 6
the walls of the pelennor: 6
the shadow of the gate: 6
the gate of the city: 6
the first circle of the: 6
first circle of the city: 6
the house of the stewards: 6
the last remnant of the: 6
the knights of dol amroth: 6
either side of the gate: 6
and went out and he: 6
of the king are the: 6
the king are the hands: 6
king are the hands of: 6
are the hands of a: 6
to the warden of the: 6
in the days of its: 6
the love of the lord: 6
captains of the west were: 6
put on the ring and: 6
almost as if he had: 6
of the captains of the: 6
only for a little while: 6
as they came to the: 6
the walls of the city: 6
the arms of the mountain: 6
> < br > the: 6
to rule them all one: 5
rule them all one ring: 5
them all one ring to: 5
all one ring to find: 5
and i should like to: 5
the shadow of the past: 5
the scouring of the shire: 5
of the red book of: 5
the end of the third: 5
to keep an eye on: 5
in the light of morning: 5
there was a great deal: 5
this age of the world: 5
and i dont want to: 5
as long as it is: 5
could not make out what: 5
the top of the hill: 5
he sat down on the: 5
at the side of the: 5
the light of the moon: 5
on to the top of: 5
out of the shadow of: 5
of the shadow of the: 5
shadow of the trees and: 5
i do not like this: 5
in the affairs of wizards: 5
for a long while and: 5
was no sign of the: 5
of the wind in the: 5
this way and that as: 5
how are you going to: 5
felt that he could not: 5
found themselves in a wide: 5
and they were forced to: 5
in front of them and: 5
the house of tom bombadil: 5
filled with the light of: 5
it was a long and: 5
there was a noise like: 5
he wondered if he would: 5
looked out of the window: 5
and they saw that he: 5
was no more than a: 5
for some time and then: 5
he did not know it: 5
before long they came to: 5
on the top of a: 5
at the door of the: 5
where do you come from: 5
he is one of the: 5
put your foot in it: 5
i will tell you what: 5
caught a glimpse of a: 5
it had not been for: 5
was no sign of any: 5
was in a hurry and: 5
we can go no further: 5
morning dawned bright and fair: 5
as soon as they had: 5
every now and again a: 5
had not gone very far: 5
to keep up with the: 5
in the late afternoon they: 5
out from the trees and: 5
of the people of the: 5
but it could not be: 5
and he found that he: 5
but there was still a: 5
what do you say to: 5
to pass the doors of: 5
what shall we do with: 5
if he had been allowed: 5
down the river to the: 5
all the time they were: 5
what do you mean by: 5
at last with an effort: 5
they crossed the bridge and: 5
in some hollow of the: 5
and it is no good: 5
in the dungeons of the: 5
what did i tell you: 5
and he fell with a: 5
the middle of the floor: 5
and after a while they: 5
was not at all to: 5
light was in his eyes: 5
could hear the sound of: 5
in the days that followed: 5
put his head in his: 5
his head in his hands: 5
at length he spoke again: 5
between the mountain and the: 5
made up his mind that: 5
on the face of the: 5
but i am glad that: 5
the light of his eyes: 5
the branches of the trees: 5
seemed to be in a: 5
near to the end of: 5
the end of the line: 5
at the rising of the: 5
but i do not know: 5
i do not know how: 5
near to the borders of: 5
between the wall and the: 5
until he came to the: 5
the boles of the trees: 5
and the smell of the: 5
i should have liked to: 5
should have liked to see: 5
company that set out from: 5
that set out from rivendell: 5
back at last to the: 5
from the shadow of the: 5
he gave a great cry: 5
it will not be long: 5
that they had come to: 5
of the misty mountains and: 5
